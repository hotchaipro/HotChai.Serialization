Serialize.NET
=============

A cross-platform library for efficiently serializing objects into a variety of formats.

Features
========

* Simple and effective support for backward compatibility when adding new serialized object members.

* Stream-based API doesn't require the entire object to reside in memory.

* Supports a variety of serialization formats, including [JSON](http://json.org), [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), [Bencode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode), and [PBON](http://pbon.info), with a single API.

* Portable implementation supports all .NET runtimes including Mono, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android.

* Visual Studio Shared Project support for easy inclusion of source code in your project.

* Supports transmitting objects between platforms (regardless of processor endianness, for example).

* Supports inspection of the underlying byte stream, which enables scenarios such as digital signing.

* Suitable for extending into higher-level abstractions, for example, a messaging protocol.
